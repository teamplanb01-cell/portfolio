We test note-only inference to reduce latency and API cost.\n\n## Approach\nCompare Gemini, local baselines, and rule-based early-stop policies on historical notes. Evaluate using ROC-AUC and calibration.\n\n## Results\n- ROC-AUC: **0.87**\n- F1: **0.79**\n\n## Learnings\nPrompt structure matters more than model size in note-only setting.\n"
